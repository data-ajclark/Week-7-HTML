  <p>Nigiri is one of the most common types of sushi and it is usually composed of fresh fish or other types of seafood neatly draped over a small mound of vinegar-seasoned rice.</p>
  <p>Historically, nigiri became popular in the early 1920s in Tokyo as a fast grab and go lunch item.</p>

  <p>Sashimi is technically just raw fish, but freshness quality and cut matter. Since it is served raw, sashimi is made with very high-quality fish.</p>
  <p>In the 17th century, shashimi grew in popularity.</p>

  <h2>Chirashi</h2>

  <p>In Japanese the word chirashi means "scattered" which perfectly decribes the cuts of fish and seafood placed on top a bed of sushi rice.</p>
  <p>Chirashi suchi is a variation of Edomae sushi, which originated in Tokyo during the Meiji Period (1868-1912).</p>

  <h2>Oshizushi</h2>

  <p>Oshizushi is not as well know as other types of sushi. It is essentially a layered sushi with rice and assorted toppings that are molded in a box then cut into square or rectangular shapes.</p>
  <p>This is one of the oldest forms of sushi which originated more than 400 years ago in the Kansai region of Osaka.</p>

  <h2>Temaki</h2>

  <p>Temaki is your traditional hand-rolled sushi, and it is a good first time starter sushi for those who have never had it. It is dried seaweed paper with sushi rice and various fillings (normally veggies and fish) rolled into a roll.</p>
  <p>The history of temaki can be traced back to 19th century Edo. It was made out of a necessity to find a more convenient way to eat the sushi they loved.</p>

  <h2>Uramaki</h2>

  <p>Uramaki rolls are commonly referred to as inside out rolls, mainly referring to the rice being on the outside of the seaweed wrap with extra fillings on the inside and even some on top.</p>
  <p>This sushi has a birth place of the United States in the late 1960s, when nori (seaweed) was still considered an exotic ingredient.</p>
